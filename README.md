^To run the application.

Why did you make this?
At first I created a higher and lower game, where the user would guess if the random number created by the computer is greater or lower than shown number, i.e. 50.
But I decided, to slighly alter the game to head or tails as essentially the high or low was a 50/50 odd game. Additionally,
it didn't provide a setting in which I could go a level of difficulty, i.e. providing 4 options to find a key.
